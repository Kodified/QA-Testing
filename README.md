# QA-Testing Repository Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for QA testing examples and candidate evaluation materials. It includes practical demonstrations of test automation using various frameworks and languages, alongside guidelines for assessing QA candidates.

## Test Automation Examples

The repository is structured to provide clear examples for different testing tools:

- **Playwright:** Located in the `Playwright` folder, this section contains a sample Playwright project. You'll find instructions within this folder to install dependencies and execute the example tests. The `public` directory, situated in the repository root, hosts example web pages used by these tests.

- **Selenium:** Examples using Selenium are provided for multiple programming languages:
  - `Selenium-java`: Contains Selenium examples implemented in Java.
  - `Selenium-python`: Contains Selenium examples implemented in Python.
  - `Selenium-javascript`: Contains Selenium examples implemented in JavaScript.
    Each of these folders includes specific setup instructions and placeholder tests designed to mirror common evaluation questions.

## Candidate Evaluation

The `CandidateEvaluation.md` file (previously in the repository root) outlines the criteria and questions for evaluating QA candidates. Its content is now integrated here for easier access.

Follow the specific instructions within each framework's folder (`Playwright`, `Selenium-java`, etc.) to set up and run the respective examples.
