# QA-Testing

This repository contains a sample Playwright project located in the `Playwright` folder. The `public` directory with example pages and `CandidateEvaluation.md` are located in the repository root. Follow the instructions in the Playwright folder to install dependencies and run the example tests.

In addition to the Playwright sample, there are Selenium examples in the `Selenium-java`, `Selenium-python` and `Selenium-javascript` folders. Each contains setup instructions and placeholder tests mirroring the evaluation questions.
